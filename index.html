  <h1>Welcome to the mobile web</h1>

  <amp-img src="sbucks.jpg" alt="Starbucks" height="600" width="800" layout="responsive"></amp-img>

  <p>At the Starbucks near Columbia University, dozens of students sought refuge from one of New York City's worst snow storms
    in 2018 over their cups of hot coffee. At a nearby table, a hoodie-wearing web developer sat intently staring at lines
    of colorful code as he began a new project. He had been planning to attend Google's AMP Roadshow, a day-long workshop
    intended to promote the company's answer to the slow load times of content-heavy webpages on mobile devices. Unfortunately
    for Veekas Shrivastava, even the technology industry's most powerful company could not justify opening its Manhattan
    office for visitors that day, forcing the developer to relocate to his neighborhood coffee shop to work through the tutorials
    on his own.</p>

  <p>He began the first workshop entitled
    <a href="https://www.ampproject.org/docs/getting_started/create.html">"Create Your First AMP Page"</a>,
    in which he learned the minimum standards of an AMP-compliant page. Many of these standards
    meant to promote responsive design would be familiar to any web developer in 2018, but there are some additions. After
    adding a trendy &lt;html âš¡&gt; tag to specify that the page is AMP-compatible, one must add HTML code for AMP pages must
    include a link to the AMP JavaScript library, and CSS boilerplate to hide content until the page finishes loading.</p>

  <p>Shrivastava also found it interesting that Google decided to forego old-fashioned HTML &lt;img&gt; tags for &lt;amp-img&gt;,
    and the same 'amp-' prefix for &lt;audio&gt; and &lt;video&gt;. He read that they did this to control the layout and prioritize resource-loading. Although the tutorial described how to link non-AMP and AMP pages by linking them in the &lt;head&gt; tag, he found it difficult to imagine a scenario in which a developer would want to duplicate code instead of providing fallback tags. He read about some convenient in-line image layout tricks such as 'sizes="50vw"' and 'layout="responsive"'.</p>
